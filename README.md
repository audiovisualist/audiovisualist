## â€¢ Hello GitHub â€¢

### I'm looking for help with pinafore.social.<br>https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore


For 'Ons Tweede Thuis'(OTT), 'Our Second Home', a Dutch organisation for people with disabilities, I'm looking for some added accessibility features on top of the marvelous webclient Pinafore for Mastodon, created by @nolanlawson. <br>https://www.onstweedethuis.nl

For example: I'd like to add a fontsize feature, for clients to be able to choose a different fontsize.
And it would be marvelous if screenreader features could be added/embedded.

This is my maiden voyage on GitHub. I'm not a programmer, but will try to build my version of Pinafore with a little help from my AI friend.
First to default PinoforeOTT to a bigger font, just by changing the CSS...âš¡âš¡ I hope ðŸ˜„

Help appreciated, but for now I will first start studying more GitHub tutorials.

I just created my first fork... hapiness ðŸ˜„

Thanks, cheers, Less
